This is a reposity which I treat as a scratchpad to implement a very rudimentary variant of UInput Orchestrator (https://github.com/kermitfrog/inputmangler/issues/5) so I can test the viability of some concepts.

This code is not intended to be used in the actual UInput Orchestrator. No attention has been paid to code quality.

I haven't figured out the ideal license for UInput Orchestrator. The code on this repository is GPLv2+, but I am not saying that that is the license that UInput Orchestrator should have.
